### --Manual installation instructions--

**IMPORTANT:** If you're using the Windows portable version of ComfyUI, which includes an embedded Python environment, you will first need to install the `diffusers` module:

### 1. Install the `diffusers` library for ComfyUI (Windows Portable Version)

   - **Locate your main `ComfyUI_windows_portable` directory.**
      - It might be named differently, but this is the main directory where you extracted the ComfyUI portable version. It contains folders like *ComfyUI*, *python_embeded*, and others.

   - **Navigate to the `ComfyUI Windows Portable` Directory via a Command Prompt:**
      - Open a Command Prompt by pressing `Win + R`, or typing `cmd`, and pressing `Enter`.
      - Use the `cd` command to change the current directory to the `ComfyUI_windows_portable` directory. For example:
        ```sh
        cd C:\path\to\your\ComfyUI_windows_portable
        ```

   - **Install the library using the embedded Python interpreter:**
      - While in the `ComfyUI_windows_portable` directory, run the following command:
        ```sh
        .\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install diffusers
        ```
        it should look like this:
        ```sh
        \ComfyUI_windows_portable>.\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install diffusers
        ```
        
   - **NOT Windows Portable Version:**
      - if you are using your system Python, virtual environment (or Conda environment), run:
        ```sh
        pip install diffusers
        ```
These steps will ensure that the **diffusers** module is installed **within the embedded Python environment used by ComfyUI.**

---

### 2. Install a ControlNet model
There are many places you can download depth ControlNet models, but the one we recommend is `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors` from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-depth/tree/main).

To do this:
1) **Download the model:**
   - Download the `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors` file from the link above (https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-depth/tree/main).

2) **Move the model to the controlnet folder:**
   - After download is comlpete, move the file to the `controlnet` subfolder inside the `models` folder of your ComfyUI directory:
     ```sh
     C:\path\to\your\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI\models\controlnet
     ```
<br>

- **OPTIONAL**
  - **--Additional Sources for ControlNet Models--**
      - **SD-1.5:** You can find depth models here: https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1/tree/main. Look for files labeled as `depth`.
      - **SD-XL:** Control-Lora models can be found here: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/control-lora/tree/main.
      - **You can also install models directly from Comfy Manager**:
        - Open Comfy
        - Go to `Manager > Model Manager (Install Models)`
        - Search using keywords like *"controlnet"* or *"depth"* to find and install the desired models

<br>

### 3. Install IPAdapter:
   1. **Install IPAdapter Plus custom nodes in ComfyUI**
      - Open Comfy
      - Go to `Manager > Custom Nodes Manager (Install Custom Nodes)`
      - Search using the keyword *"ipadapter"*
      - Click `Install` on the one called `ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus` by `cubiq`
   2. **Install CLIP Vision models**
      - go to https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
      - follow the instructions for `/ComfyUI/models/clip_vision` part:
           - download only the first two CLIP Vision models and rename (the file name gets changed when downloading)
      - make sure to move CLIP Vision models to `...\models\clip_vision`
   3. **Install IPAdapter models**
      - navigate to `C:\path\to\your\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI\models`
      - inside `models`, create a new folder called `ipadapter`
      - go to https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
      - download the `.safetensors` files of your choice depending on the preferred SD version
           - **IMPORTANT: We recommend _at least_ downloading:**
                - **SD-1.5:** `ip-adapter-plus_sd15.safetensors`, *"Plus model, very strong"* version
                - **SD-XL:** `ip-adapter-plus_sdxl_vit-h.safetensors`, *"SDXL plus model"* version
      - move the downloaded files to newly created ipadapter folder `...\models\ipadapter`

---

### 4. Make sure you have the SD models (checkpoints)
   **We recommend:**
   - **For SD-1.5:** https://civitai.com/models/104608/ai-angel-mix
   - **For SD-XL-1.0:** https://civitai.com/models/140737/albedobase-xl

---

### 5. Last, clone the Pseudorandom repository:
Clone this repo inside your `custom_nodes` folder by:
   1. **Navigate to:** `C:\path\to\your\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI\custom_nodes`
   2. **Open the folder inside a Command Prompt and type:**
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/Pseudotools/Pseudocomfy.git
      ```
